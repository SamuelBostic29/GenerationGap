This project was originally created by my self and various CS students who took CSCI-499
with Dr. Adam Whitley at UNCA. I will have made my own changes to this project that may not exist on the original.
At this time Dr. Whitley does not have a license on the project but has given me permission to use the project in
my portfolio. If the license changes to some variant open source license this should suffice as giving original credit.
If the license changes I will remove this repository and all it's code at the original owners request.
If you would like to see the state of the project made by the team please check out commit: 01fd1fdaa052d0faf5a089bb5a8cca94f52a1fff
Note: I did remove some custom tools made by other students to avoid taking credit for work done outside the scope of the game.

At commit 01fd1fdaa052d0faf5a089bb5a8cca94f52a1fff the follow team members are given the following credits (in alphabetical order): Dr. Adam Whitley - Director/Game Design JB - Programmer (RoomGeneration/Enemy Design) JV - Programmer/Artist - (Background art/Technical Programming) ML - Programmer - (Enemy generation/Development Ops)
